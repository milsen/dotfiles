# This script checks whether a USB soundcard is connected. If so, it creates a
# ~/jackdrc which is then executed by qjackctl at startup. The executed command
# starts JACK with a real-time scheduling priority of 80. and sets JACK
# parameters for low latency and few xruns: It holds that
#                       latency = nperiods*(rate/period)
# A low latency, however, also increases the chance of xruns.
# The jackd command is equivalent to (but sometimes works better than):
#
# jack_control start
# jack_control eps realtime true
# jack_control eps realtime-priority 80
# jack_control ds alsa
# jack_control dps device hw:USB
# jack_control dps rate 44100
# jack_control dps period 128
# jack_control dps nperiods 3

# If the audio interface is not connected, exit.

  exit 1

# If JACK's not starting, see whether other processes are using the sound card:
