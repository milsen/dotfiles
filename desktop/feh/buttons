# Each binding is a button name.  It may optionally start with modifiers for
# things like Control, in which case binding looks like mod-button (for
# example C-1 for Ctrl + Left button).
# Do not use the same button for multiple actions.

# 1 left button
# 2 middle button
# 3 right button
# 4 mousewheel down
